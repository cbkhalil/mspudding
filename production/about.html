I'm a former classically trained dancer that was bred to have exceptionally small hands and feet.</h2><p>I spent a good portion of my upbringing indoors, playing video games of all sorts, while training to be a broadway performer (piano, singing, acting, tap dance, gymnastics, and the like). I came to be known as MsPudding from working in the videogame industry and making silly smurf account names. Somehow this one stuck.</p><p><strong>My greatest passions right now are in the realm of self improvement.</strong> These pursuits have led me to studying Mandarin, programming, and challenging myself to write every day. In tandem, I’ve become an avid home cook, and fitness/longevity are something I strive for both with activity and research.</p><p>I go on a lot of unusual adventures these days, and more and more I’ve realized they’re <em>not</em> something only the rich or privileged have within reach.</p><p class="centerQuote">Follow me for a glimpse into the life of someone who started as a shy, socially inept weakling who was completely immersed in video games, and is now riding motorcycles, climbing rocks, and hiking up mountains. </p><p>The person I’ll be tomorrow is better than I am today, and I invite you to go with me on this journey :) </p><hr></section><main class="blog-body"><h2>Privacy Policy:</h2><p class="imageCaption">This blog does not share personal information with third parties nor do I store any information about your visit to this blog other than to analyze and optimize your content and reading experience through the use of cookies.
