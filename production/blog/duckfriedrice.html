Pan-fried garlic, chili oil, and duck fat permeate every grain of rice, contrasting with the sweet corn and peas for explosive, satisfying bites.</p><p class="centerQuote">WARNING: My food is calorie dense, filling, nutritious, and bold flavored. I break rules and do weird stuff. And I’m only recommending it to you here because it was a GREAT SUCCESS.</p><a href="#Recipe"></a><p class="centerQuote">Full recipe at bottom!</p><ol><b>I have some important rules for cooking at home:</b><li>Make crazy substitutions to add protein, fiber, and healthy fats</li><li>Cook in bulk and plan for leftovers that will reheat well and be easy to portion</li><li>Don’t use shitty ingredients (processed, nutritionally lacking, filler bullshit)</li></ol><h1>First things first, I know what you’re thinking. Black beans???</h1><p>Those don’t belong in fried rice. Yeah, well we probably shouldn’t be eating fried rice in the first place! I added fiber, antioxidants, and protein to enrich this dish and make it more substantive, filling, and worth including in a balanced diet. Most importantly, it worked and it was delicious.<br><br>Here’s how it started...</p><h1>1. I bought a whole roast duck from Chinatown</h1><p>Already seasoned and cooked to perfection, I grabbed a whole duck from one of my favorite spots in San Francisco as the inspiration for this dish. <b>The duck makes up the bulk of the cost and calories, but is the centerpiece of the incredible aroma and fattiness that is… duck fried rice.</b></p><p>I pulled ALL of the meat, skin, and fat right off the bones by hand, then chopped it up a bit. The fatty bits will melt right on the pan, providing enough duck oil to fry up the rice and beans (and the low-fat diet campaign is long gone. Enjoy your healthy fats!).</p><h1>2. I fried up the fatty saucy stuff</h1><p>I started by tossing sliced garlic and onions with a drizzle of avocado oil and the duck meat/fat/skin in a large frying pan.</p><img src="/resources/images/duckfriedrice/sizzlingduck.jpg" alt="sizzling duck meat in frying pan"><p class="imageCaption">The meat browned a little and the skin crisped up. This stuff smells incredible. </p><p>I added a tablespoon of each of my two favorite sauces: Laoganma Fried Chili in Oil, and oyster sauce.</p><img src="/resources/images/duckfriedrice/oysterandchilisauce.jpg" alt="oyster sauce and chili oil sauce"><p class="imageCaption">Each of these bottles can be found at most Asian markets, for under $3.</p><p><b>Fried Chili in Oil</b> is a complex chili oil based condiment with Sichuan pepper, crisp chili flakes, crunchy peanuts, and a ton of seasonings not listed on the bottle. It adds salt, umami, and a bit of spice to things, and is my go-to for daily use.</p><p><b>Oyster sauce</b> adds salt, a hint of sweetness, and a savory hint of seafood flavor to the mix without being overwhelming.</p><p>Combined with the seasoning of the duck itself, these combine to provide a perfect balance for this dish with no need for additional salt.</p><h1>3. I made rice. And beans.</h1><p>In a separate pot, I simmered Trader Joe’s brown rice medley and added a can of drained black beans to the pot as it cooked. I don’t own a rice cooker right now, but that would work too.</p><img src="/resources/images/duckfriedrice/brownricemedley.jpg" alt="Trader Joe's Brown Rice Medley 16oz bag"><p class="imageCaption">About $2 at Trader Joe's! This makes... so much rice.</p><p>The result was moist and fragrant, and the beans are already cooked so they come out even softer.</p><p><b>But wait--</b></p><p>Fried rice is typically made with dried out day-old rice! This is all wrong!<br><br> 
Well, it is! Sort of. It takes a bit of patience, but I’ll explain how I got my rice to crisp and fry nicely.

</p><h1>4. I mashed the rice mixture into the saucy duck bits and flattened it out</h1><p>This is why a large pan is handy. Getting a good flat surface is key for frying up the rice and drying it out a bit so it’s not too sticky and wet.</p><img src="/resources/images/duckfriedrice/flattenedrice.jpg" alt="duck fried rice flattened on frying pan"><p class="imageCaption">At this point I've added eggs, peas, and corn to the mixture, then flattened it against the pan!</p><h1>5. Patience, and spatulas</h1><p>A minute or two later on med-high heat, the rice should be crisp and browned on the bottom.</p><img src="/resources/images/duckfriedrice/spatulaflip.jpg" alt="flipping crispy duck fried rice in the pan"><p>Flipping each section and smashing it down into the wet mixture, I repeated this 4-5 times. I also added eggs and mashed them in as part of this process. It takes some time for the excess water to evaporate off and get a crispy finish.</p><h1>6. Finishing seasonings!</h1><p>Tossing the crisped mixture into a large bowl, I seasoned with a drizzle of sesame oil, tons of white pepper, and some chopped scallions and cilantro.</p><img src="/resources/images/duckfriedrice/finishedfriedrice.jpg" alt="duck fried brown rice with black beans"><p class="imageCaption">No joke, there's enough fried rice in here for a small child to go swimming in it.</p><p>I made three batches. This resulted in 9 pint-sized mason jars worth of food. Sealed tightly and packed while still hot, they’ll keep easily for the week (longer if frozen!), and there’s plenty to share. :)</p></main><article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Recipe"><span itemprop="author" style="display: none">Christine Brynn</span><div class="blog-body"><img itemprop="image" src="/resources/images/duckfriedrice/masonjarfriedrice.jpg" alt="duck fried rice packed in mason jars"></div><div class=".recipe-anchor" id="Recipe"></div><div class="recipe-card"><div class="recipe-title"><h1 itemprop="name">Duck Fried Brown Rice with Black Beans</h1><h2 itemprop="recipeYield">Serves 9. 2-cup servings.
