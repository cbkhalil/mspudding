		<h4>Hi, I'm Christine. I'm a former classically trained dancer that was bred to have exceptionally small hands and feet.</h4>
		<p>
			I spent a good portion of my upbringing indoors, playing video games of all sorts, while training to be a broadway performer (piano, singing, acting, tap dance, gymnastics, and the like). I came to be known as MsPudding from working in the videogame industry and making silly smurf account names. Somehow this one stuck.

			<strong>My greatest passions right now are in the realm of self improvement.</strong> These pursuits have led me to studying Mandarin, programming, and challenging myself to write every day. In tandem, I’ve become an avid home cook, and fitness/longevity are something I strive for both with activity and research.
		</p>
		<p>
			I go on a lot of unusual adventures these days, and more and more I’ve realized they’re <em>not</em> something only the rich or privileged have within reach.

			Follow me for a glimpse into the life of someone who started as a shy, socially inept weakling who was completely immersed in video games, and is now riding motorcycles, climbing rocks, and hiking up mountains. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The person I’ll be tomorrow is better than I am today, and I invite you to go with me on this journey :) 
		</p>

			I’m learning to build a site from scratch. Right now it’s hosted on Cloudfront with Route 53 for DNS, and on the front end I’m fiddling with HTML/CSS, jQuery, and a bit of bootstrap that I’ll be replacing soon! All of my blog posts I styled myself, with zero pre-built integration from existing blog platforms. Currently making plans to make everything sharable with comments, but I didn’t want to take the easy way out by grabbing a pre-made site layout!
