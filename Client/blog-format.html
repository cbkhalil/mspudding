	<h3>Pudding arrives in Taipei</h3>
	<p>My bargain flight tickets led me on quite a journey. Instead of doing new years’ resolutions for 2016, I had the idea to create a list of 30-day challenges with the underlying motive of making me a better, healthier person. Self transformation! That thing we’re all quietly striving for, but not actively pursuing even though we mean to.
For February, I’m eating vegan — we’re eating vegan! I’m doing this with my partner in crime. If this was going to be a real challenge I knew that going vegetarian would be too easy. I enjoy so many foods that don’t have meat in them that it would just become a temporary rice/pasta/bread binge. </p>
