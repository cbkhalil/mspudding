Please don’t hurt yourself.</p><p>Now, for you risky adventurous folk… here’s how I paired an awesome day trip bike ride with a Pokemon adventure.</p><img class="header-img" src="/images/Pokemononabike/panoramatiburon.jpg" alt="panorama view of bike trail in tiburon"><p class="imageCaption">My view along the bike trail in Tiburon</p><h2>I got a phone mount and external charger</h2><p>With good visibility and access to my phone screen on a whim, I put my sound on blast (minus the music), so I wouldn’t have to fumble to take my phone out or put it away. </p><p>This also meant my phone was fixed in place, so no AR mode, and no battery saver.  An external charger was a must. I kept my charger in my jacket pocket, safely stringing a cord out to plug into the stand.</p><img src="/images/Pokemononabike/phonemount.jpg" alt="phone mount on bicycle for pokemon go"><blockquote><strong>A note for iOS users</strong>: if you use “low power mode” in your battery settings, that won’t work well while biking around because it pings the map too infrequently for egg hatching! At a biking speed, fewer pings to the map will make the game think you’re going way too fast.</blockquote><p>Biking speed is also noticeably worse for hatching eggs in general. It'll detect activity, but it won't be accurate to how far you actually traveled. A leisure speed is recommended if you care deeply about this!</p><h2>I planned out a full day of activity</h2><p>Letting Pokemon Go lead me around the city was fine on foot. </p><p><strong>The problem arises when you’re letting the game dictate your day, AND you’re dragging a bicycle + gear along with you.</strong></p><p>I would not advise pedaling through busy streets, dodging cars, and visiting pokestops on your bicycle. It’s risky, and not nearly as fun as walking in a group with friends. The frequency of spawns in downtown areas would get you stopping constantly on foot anyway, so the bike would just be a nuisance. </p><p>My recommendation is to plan an outing that would only be <em>enhanced</em> with a Pokemon run. A real adventure!</p><h2>I plotted my route to stay on dedicated bike trails</h2><p>Looking for city attractions, I google mapped the cycling path to the Tiburon Ferry terminal, across the Golden Gate Bridge and through long stretches of bike trails. 18 miles total, so it’d be quite a trip.</p><p>There are typically fewer pokestops and spawns on the trails I found, but that was important for this to work. 
<strong>In order for my bike ride to not be CONSTANTLY interrupted by the game, I needed the density of game content to be spread out a bit.</strong></p><p>And ya know… not being around cars helped too.</p><h2>I stopped to catch things</h2><p>While riding, it was pretty easy to tap on pokestops along the way without having to devote much attention to my screen, but actually throwing pokeballs was decidedly too dangerous. This was another great reason to have my sound on blast: listening for spawns instead of staring at my screen the whole time!</p><p>On a bike trail it was really easy to pull over, so I’d pause quickly to catch things when they popped up. Yelling out “WAAAIT! BULBASAUR!” while riding along was probably quite the spectacle as well.</p><h2>I chose a cozy spot to recharge at</h2><p>The cafe near the ferry building has plentiful booth seating, great grilled cheese sandwiches, coffee, pastries, and gelato. Ample reward for a long day of cycling, and a sweet spot to rest my legs for a bit!</p><h2>The way back was easier than the way there</h2><p>As a beginner to cycling, I wanted to give myself an out in case the 18+ mile ride back home was too daunting. The ferry back into the city would be a comfortable trip back into town (and a gorgeous view!). </p><img src="/images/Pokemononabike/ferrysanfrancisco.jpg" alt="ferry from tiburon to san francisco"><p>This was also an excuse to catch some water pokemon. Well at least I thought so. All I found was a Sandshrew in the bay but it was worth a try!</p><img class="narrowImage" src="/images/Pokemononabike/pokemongoinwater.jpg" alt="Playing Pokemon Go in water on a boat"><p>All in all, I still think bikes are not really supposed to be paired with Pokemon Go. But nonetheless there’s some egg hatching potential, and who doesn’t need a bit more drive to get outside and do something fun?
